# JavaScript Projects

This repository is a collection of my JavaScript learning projects.

Each folder or file will showcase a concept, small project, or exercise I've worked on while improving my JavaScript skills. These may include DOM manipulation, event handling, basic applications, and more as I progress.

Feel free to explore â€” feedback is always welcome!
